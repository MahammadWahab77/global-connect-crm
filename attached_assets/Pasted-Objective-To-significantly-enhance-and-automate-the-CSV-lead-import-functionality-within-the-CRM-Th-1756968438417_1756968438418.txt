Objective
To significantly enhance and automate the CSV lead import functionality within the CRM. The goal is to improve data integrity, streamline the lead distribution process, and ensure critical information from the import file is accurately captured and assigned, thereby reducing manual work and improving operational efficiency.

Problem
The current CSV import process has several limitations that create manual work and lead to data inconsistencies:

Unassigned Counselors: Leads imported with a specified counselor in the Counsellors column are not being automatically assigned. They all appear as "Unassigned," forcing administrators to manually distribute them after the import is complete.

No Fallback Assignment: There is no defined process for handling cases where the counselor named in the CSV does not exist in the system or when a name is misspelled. This leads to ambiguity and requires manual intervention.

Loss of Initial Context: The Remarks column in the CSV, which often contains crucial initial information about the lead, is not being captured and stored in the "Remarks & Comments" section of the lead's workspace.

Lack of Traceability: The UID from the CSV is not being mapped to the lead record in the database, making it difficult to trace a lead back to its original source file for auditing or troubleshooting purposes.

Possible Solution
To resolve these issues, the backend import logic needs to be re-engineered. The following steps should be taken within the /api/leads/import-csv endpoint in server/routes.ts:

Implement Smart Counselor Assignment:

Before processing the lead rows, fetch a list of all active counselors (users with the 'counselor' role) from the database.

For each lead row in the CSV:

Read the value from the Counsellors column.

If a name is present: Perform a case-insensitive search for a matching counselor in the fetched list.

If a match is found, assign that counselor's ID to the counselorId field for the new lead and set the currentStage to an appropriate post-assignment stage like "Yet to Contact".

If no match is found (e.g., the name is "shyam"), assign the lead to a default counselor named "Likitha". The system should look up "Likitha" and use her ID.

If the field is empty: The counselorId should be null, and the currentStage should be set to "Yet to Assign".

Integrate Remarks from CSV:

For each lead created from the CSV, take the content from the Remarks column.

Create a new entry in the remarks table, linking it to the newly created lead's ID.

This will ensure the initial remark appears immediately in the "Remarks & Comments" tab in the LeadWorkspace.

Map UID to Lead Record:

During lead creation, ensure the value from the UID column in the CSV is saved to the uid column in the leads table in the database. This will serve as a persistent external identifier.

Expected Outcome
After implementing these enhancements, the CSV import process will be significantly more intelligent and efficient, resulting in:

Automated Lead Distribution: Leads will be correctly assigned to counselors based on the CSV data, eliminating the need for manual assignment.

Reliable Fallback System: A clear and consistent rule will handle any discrepancies in counselor names, ensuring no lead is left in limbo.

Preserved Lead Context: Important initial notes and remarks from the CSV will be captured and immediately available to the assigned counselor, providing better context for the first interaction.

Improved Data Traceability: Every imported lead will have a traceable UID linking it back to the source file, which is crucial for data management and quality control.

Reduced Administrative Overhead: The overall time and effort required to manage lead imports will be drastically reduced, allowing administrators to focus on more strategic tasks.
