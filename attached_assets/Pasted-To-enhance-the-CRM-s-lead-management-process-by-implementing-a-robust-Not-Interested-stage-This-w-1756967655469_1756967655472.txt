To enhance the CRM's lead management process by implementing a robust "Not Interested" stage. This will allow for more accurate sales funnel analytics and provide insights into why leads are being lost, which can inform future marketing and sales strategies.

Problem
The current CRM system lacks a dedicated and detailed "Not Interested" stage in the sales pipeline. When a lead is marked as not interested, there is no structured way to capture the specific reasons why. This results in a loss of valuable data that could be used to improve sales processes, refine marketing campaigns, and identify trends in customer objections. Without this information, it is difficult to determine whether leads are being lost due to pricing, product-market fit, timing, or other factors.

Possible Solution
To address this, we propose the following enhancements to the CRM:

Update the Lead Stages: Add a "Not Interested" stage to the PIPELINE_STAGES array in LeadWorkspace.tsx.

Introduce a "Reason for Not Interested" Field:

Add a new dropdown field to the task creation form that appears when the "Not Interested" status is selected.

This dropdown should be populated with a predefined list of common reasons, such as:

"Already started the process"

"Financial issue"

"Looking for placement/Job"

"Planning higher studies in India"

"Low financial status"

"Family unwilling to invest"

"Debt burden already exists"

"Not eligible for loan"

"No property or asset for collateral"

"Parents oppose taking loans"

"Fear of loan repayment pressure"

Implement Conditional Logic:

In LeadWorkspace.tsx, add logic to the TaskComposer component to show the "Reason for Not Interested" dropdown only when the connectStatus is "Not Interested".

The selection from this dropdown should be saved as part of the task data.

Automate Stage Progression:

In the getNextStageFromTask function in LeadWorkspace.tsx, add a rule that when a task is completed with the "Not Interested" status, the lead's stage is automatically updated to "Not Interested".

Display in Lead History:

Ensure that when a lead is moved to the "Not Interested" stage, the reason is recorded in the task history and remarks for future reference.

Expected Outcome
Upon implementing these changes, the CRM will be able to:

Capture Granular Data: Systematically collect and store the reasons why leads are marked as "Not Interested."

Improve Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports that provide insights into the most common objections and reasons for losing leads.

Enhance Decision-Making: Use the data to make informed decisions about sales training, marketing messaging, and product development.

Streamline Workflow: Automate the process of moving leads to the "Not Interested" stage, saving time and ensuring consistency.

Increase Sales Effectiveness: By understanding why leads are being lost, the sales team can better address objections and improve their conversion rates over time.
